# TheFirstProject
<h2>Basic Feed-forward Neural Networks using Keras</h2>

This was my very first project using Keras library.<br>
The project was based on Binary Classification using Feed-forward Neural Networks.<br>
The classification task was done on Breast Cancer dataset which has two categories as Benign(B) or Malignant(M).<br>
You can take the dataset(.csv file) from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data">here</a>.
